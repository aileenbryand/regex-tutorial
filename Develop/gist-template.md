## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors belong to the family of regex tokens that don't match any characters, but that assert something about the string or the matching process.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.

### OR Operator
| Indicates an OR operator. For example: couch|chair finds couch or chair.
### Character Classes
 a character class is a set of characters enclosed within square brackets. It specifies the characters that will successfully match a single character from a given input string.
### Flags
A flag is an optional parameter to a regex that modifies its behavior of searching.
### Grouping and Capturing
Groups group multiple patterns as a whole, and capturing groups provide extra submatch information when using a regular expression pattern to match against a string.
### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions are a list of characters and/or character classes enclosed in brackets
### Greedy and Lazy Match
'Greedy' means match longest possible string. 'Lazy' means match shortest possible string. 
### Boundaries
These 3 positions are word boundaries: Before the first character in a string if the first character is a word character. After the last character in a string if the last character is a word character. Between two characters in a string if one is a word character and the other is not.
### Back-references
regular expression commands which refer to a previous part of the matched regular expression
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Lookahead allows to add a condition for “what follows”. Lookbehind is similar, but it looks behind
